She is proud to be connected to the foundation and glad to be involved without a huge demand of her time. BM is happy that her grandchildren are becoming more involved with the foundation, including becoming trustees and associates.

5:00 Recently, the foundation has decided to exist in perpetuity. BM envisions future generations staying involved. RM has been glad to see the third and fourth generation assume more leadership and responsibilities at the foundation. RM hopes the fourth generation will feel more comfortable voicing their interests and help to shape the future of the foundation.

9:45 JMP feels empowered as an associate with the board of Nathan Cummings Foundation. BM’s father had faith and confidence in the younger people around him.

14:45 When BM was growing up, both her grandparents were founders of synagogues and community organizations. Kindness and tzedakah were impressed upon BM. Action is more important than making plans. “Nothing will ever be accomplished if all obstacles must be overcome first.”

20:00 RM was always surrounded by community outreach and support. Their family was always inviting people to see art and bringing food and clothing to the needy. That legacy was transmitted to RM’s generation.

22:30 Tzedakah was instilled in JMP’s upbringing -- she planted many trees in Israel. JMP’s brother made a bologna sandwich for BM one time because he though older people needed food. When JMP was in high school, she founded a philanthropy club. The importance of giving back has been taught to JMP.

26:15 Charity is more passive giving, while philanthropy is more personal. This is the reason RM has decided to spend the rest of his career involved in philanthropy. BM makes a gift each year to her grandchildren. She likes them to divide it 3 ways: 1/3 for personal use, 1/3 for investments, 1/3 for donations.

TRACK 2

0:00 During the Civil Rights Movement, BM went to Mississippi and saw how workers were treated in the fields. It was gratifying for BM to spend time with the workers’ children during the days.

6:00 BM would like the foundation to focus more on the area of disability. There is a need and it is hard to understand disability until you have felt what it is like to lose some mobility, etc.

13:00 The “sundance compact” provided independent review of qualifications for board members. It changed the criteria from entitlement to merit. The board hasn’t always had all the skills it has required because of the composition of the board. Now they are more concerned with skills and abilities rather than family balance.

19:00 When BM started the foundation, there were no set program interests. They modeled it on Nathan Cummings’ interests: heath, art, Jewish affairs, and later added environment. In the future, the program areas may change due to new interests of younger generations. Society is changing rapidly, so new programs needs may present themselves.

23:00 RM thinks that unless the foundation is more flexible in serving the needs of the community and foundation, it will cease to be a true family foundation. BM’s favorite sayings: “with privilege comes responsibility” ",,3,"Mayer, Buddy ",granddaughter/daughter,son/father,,"StoryCorps General","Mayer, Robert J.",,,,"StoryCorps General",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Phinney, Jaimie Mayer",grandmother/mother,,,"StoryCorps General",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no,no,,,,English,,,,,,"Art

12:40  Will found the most difficult part of being a teacher was trying to reach everyone in the class, even with a large class of 35 students.  

15:55 Will has worked both in elementary and high schools.  Drops outs rates and other High School problems arise from a combination of academic and social challenges.

20:25  Will wasn't the best or worst high school student.  He also worried about being cool and fitting in.  But he remembers Mr. Surge who inspired him to love history.  He said that history was the most interesting and important subject because it includes all the facets of life in the one subject.

Brooks worked for the postal service for over 30 years. She’s also an entrepreneur keeping her mother’s (Ruby Mae McKay) memory alive through Ruby’s Bakery, Ruby’s Precious Tots (day care) and Ruby’s Ministry.
2:40 Her life is a walk with God and the church.  Her family is from Georgia.  Her parents are from South Carolina (her mom - I did not catch where her father is from but I know it was not South Carolina).  Her grandmother is Grandma Pearl McKellar McKay.  Grandma Pearl’s grandma was Grandma Sly.  Grandma Pearl’s son is William McKellar McKay.  He’s Rev’s father’s (Arthur Lee McKay) father.  Grandma Sly was very pro black.  KKK members came to her home for her to wash their clothes.  She took the clothes, dragged them in dirt and returned them to the KKK unwashed.
Rev. Brooks mom was a god-fearing woman and care-giver.
5:33 Rev was 6 yrs old when her grandmother told her to be ready for god’s call.  She is now a minister for Ruby’s Ministry and Carey Tercentenary A.M.E. (I spelled it wrong on my log sheets).  She joined this church when she moved to Chicago.  Her grandmother Pearl was the first funeral held at Carey Tercentenary A.M.E. (African Methodist Episcopal).  After grandma Pearl died she told Rev. in a vision to walk with god.
11:30 church taught her all the graces - culture, sewing, cooking, posture, respect for self and elders.
13:30 Rev. is a mom of 6 - Rita, Diane, Shirley, Jerome, Vincent (a minister), Christopher, Robert (airforce).  These children are by her husband Herbert Brooks.  Her oldest son, Donald Edwards is by her first husband, Egbert Edwards.  he was from the West Indies.  He died when donald was 9 years old.  Rev. has 26 grand kids.
16:57 The lord finally called Rev. to preach on a plane from Bermuda in 1979.  It started shaking. She said she would spread the word and take care of god’s lamb and it stopped shaking.  When she got to church that sunday morning she confessed her sins.  She went on to get a degree in Theology from Chicago State University.  She started her ministry when she retired from the US Postal Service in 1992.  It took her 10 years to get her degree but she did it..  The first sermon that she gave was “If you love me, feed my lambs”.  Through her ministry and mom’s memorial, she’s started a community breakfast program, clothing drive and prison ministry.
24:30 Rev. got a chance to address President Kennedy to stress the needs of children.  She was president of the PTA and campaigned on behalf of children and schools.

The best moment was that they both survived.
1:39 Earliest memory was the landlord (Mr. Reaner?) coming to collect the rent from his mother.  His mom cursed and tried to do the landlord bodily harm.  The landlord fled.  The building was in very bad condition.  2 months after they moved the building fell down.
3:02 Regrets - he would like to have known more.  Also he would like to have known his father sooner in his life.
4:20 He’s been to over 32 countries.  Would like to see more of the over 200 that exist.
8:50 Describes growing up in Chicago.  Very mixed and very poor neighborhood.  They had complete integration in the neighborhood until after WWII.  When the soldiers began coming back the girls were of child-bearing age.  The whites moved to the suburbs.  The government allocated the apartments to colored people.  Eventually they became Cabrini Green Projects.
13:05 He was raised with his mom and grandmom.  He remembers that his mom was non-sexy but had a strong work ethic.  She was a laundress.  After awhile mom only did shirts.  Grandma ran the house.  He did the packing and delivering of laundry.  His other job was to take care of the bills.  He was 6 or 7 then.  He would get on his bike and go to the utility companies to pay the bills.
18:40 He went to a mixed school.  He was a goo student.  Classmates would call him sissy billy because he always had the latest clothes.  His mom would get them from one of her customers had a son around his age and they would give her the sons hand-me-downs.
27:50 His first bout of discrimination - There was a military Ball that was happening through his schoo and he was in the ROTC.  He and the other blacks were told that they could not go because the place where it was held did not serve black people.  One of the boys he was with told the woman that he had an uncle who worked for a major black newspaper and if they did not let them go he would tell his uncle.  She came back and said that yes they could go but they would have to sit at a seperate table.  They said ok but they needed 3 tables.  They took their friends from the hood who didn’t go to the school.  This was at the Stevens hotel which is now the Hilton Hotel.  They had tuxes and limos.  Limos because some of their father’s were chauffeurs so they drove them in the limos.
32:50 He is a practicing Christian Scientist and has been since he was 4 years old.  He contributes this to his good health over the years.
34:15 Miracles and visions - at 71 years old he had to go to the hospital for the first time.  Prostate problems.  He had to have 3 operations.  He had a dream that made him question if he would live.  The voice in the dream said “no, go to sleep”.
36:00 His mom’s family was from Greenscut (?) GA.  His dad was named Edwin Dawson from N. Carolina.  His dad came to Chicago and impregnated his mom and a few other women. The other women’s family ran him out of Chicago.  He met his dad again at 39 years old.  They stayed in touch until his dad died at age 79.  His mom too lived to 79.  Her name was Susie Harvey.  Grandma was named Anna Gilbert and his Granddad was Albert Gilbert.  His mom was a harvey because she was married before he was born.

Weaver","2:00 Their dad, George Weaver, came from Indiana.  Their mom, Charolotte Weaver said he traced his family history to 1850.  They heard that there was a Weaver Settlement in Indiana at the turn of the century.  Mom was from Alabama.  She was the daughter of a professor in Alabama. 
4:00 Mom and dad met at the Phyllis Weatley Residental Home for Single Girls.  Mom had gone to college and travelled a bit.  She was always a bit embarrassed to admit that 9 months and 7 days after they met Theresa was born.
6:25 Dad died 3/4/30 seven months before Georgette was born.  Mom was 28 yars old, 2 kids, during the depression with no husband.  She was a day worker (cleaning homes for white people).  She worked for $1 per day and car fare. They were on Welfare.  To get welfare mom had to go to court to prove that she had been married to their father.
11:15 Mom was tough.  She was never mushy.  She didn’t like mushy cards for Mother’s day.  She wanted an electric saw.  She had to be that way to survive. She did what she had to do to take care of her children.  She didn’t rely on men.  They never saw men in their home until they were teenagers.
15:00 they knew they were better than other people not because they were light-skinned but because they were Charlotte’s children.  Mom was proud to be black before black was in fashion.
16:15 Most of their furniture was made from orange crates.  They lived with various people.  When they finally got a place where they only shared the bathroom with 1 other person they were delighted.  When they got a place where they had their own bathroom they thought they had made it.
24:50 When mom was pregnant with Georgette the Doctor suggested she get an abortion because their father had died.  Mom would not do it because it was her husbands baby.  She adored her husband.  If it was a boy she was going to name him George Jr.  Since it was a girl she named her Georgette.
26:45 Mom had sisters and 1 brother.  Her brother, uncle Tom, was blind because he was chopping wood one day and a wood chip got into his eye.  Her sister’s names were Aunt Mamie, Aunt Sue, Aunt Eunice.  They would all spend Thanksgiving, Easter and Christmas together.
29:10 Mom passed away in 1987 at the age of 85.
30:15 Mom put Georgette through college on a day worker’s salary.  It was about $1000 per year.
32:30 Mom hated the South.  She was run out of the South for sassing a white woman.  She had been up North long enough to forget that you didn’t talk back to white people like that.  When she went home and told her family they hustled her back North.
34:10 Mom would always say “my children are pretty”.  Mom’s birthday was 9/30/1902.  She was very happy that she lived to see people walking on the moon.
37:15 Mom was proud to be black before it was popular.  People always remember her saying “take what you got and make what you want”.
39:40 She remarried in 43 and he died.  She married again after that and they got a divorce.  She went back to using her first husband’s name, Weaver.  They would always say that “mom killed her first husband, Theresa killed the second and Georgette ran the 3rd one off”.",,2,"Scott, Theresa Scott (aka JoAnn) ",,,,"StoryCorps General",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cooper, Georgetta W.

Catherine was 3 yrs old.  Sister Linda was 1 1/2.  They arrived on the Warden Johnson boat from San Francisco.
3:15 Catherine’s first memory was looking at the stairs at the entrance and at the man in the tower with a gun.
3:50 Dad (John David Herring) had just signed with the Cardinals baseball team.  In winter they had to find other work.  He saw an ad in a post office for a good job.  As a joke he said he’d take the Alcatraz Island job.  He got it and that’s where they were sent.
5:40 They were from Springfield, MO.  Ruthann and John David met in Highschool in Springfield.  More very happy/vivid descriptions of Alcatraz - Buildings - church/stores/post office/bowling alley/different denominations of faith churches.
9:00 Memories of holidays at Alcatraz - Christmas/Halloween.  Games the kids played like turtle races.  80 families lived on the Island.
10:15 Catherine remembers playing ball with a prisoner.  Didn’t know that she was not supposed to.
10:45 1959 they moved to C building.  They lived on the 3rd floor.  If you left the phone off the hook for 3 minutes security would rush to you.  More vivid happy memories - boat to San Francisco/a woman giving birth on the boat (Joann)/taking the boat to school in San Fran.
16:50 The only tree on the island was a palm tree.  It was on the Warden’s lawn.  They weren’t allowed to play on his lawn.  They had a women’s club.  The women’s club wrote and published a cook book.  Great recipe for a lemon meringue pie.
19:20 There is an Alcatraz Alumni Association.  they go to the reunions.  next reunion is 8/11/2007.  they still keep in touch with the families.  They lived there for 7 years.
20:25 They were there for the escape in 1962.  They had to move when the island closed in 1963.  Catherine still misses the fog horns.  
20:55 Prisoner’s built beautiful furniture that they owned.  Great quality / solid wood.  They took it with them and it’s floating around the world somewhere.
23:45 Inmate escape was not the only reason that the prison was closed.  The generator had broken down.  It was near Thanksgiving and Ruthann could not finish making her turkey.  The prison borrowed a generator from the Coast Guard.  It was on loan and very expensive for the government to operate.  This contributed to the closing. 
On the night of the escape the grown ups were invited to a social event on the top floor of the prison building.  They were usually not allowed in that building.  They were served pumpkin pie and it was very spicy.  They were told that since the prisoners could not have alcohol they made the food very spicy so that they could have something flavorful.  The prison break happened while they were at that social.
Catherine learned to play piano on a piano owned by Al Capone.  He had it shipped over while he was there.  They took it with them when they left.  It has since been lost or given away.  It too is floating around the world.
Alcatraz used to be an Indian reservation called Pelican Island by the Indians.  Afterward the Indian’s took it back.
31:30 The entire family loved growing up there.",,2,"Herring, Ruthann ",,,,"StoryCorps General",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Herring-Ryder, Catherine A. ",,,,"StoryCorps General",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no,no,,,,English,,,,,,"Baseball

4:40 He went to Hayti Nigger school.  That was the actual name of the school.  He once went back to see it and he noticed that they tried to scratch out the name of the school but you could still see “nigger” between the Hayti and School.
5:00 He and his 3 brothers worked picking cotton to help the family financially.  They started school late because of this.  They graduated at the same time.
8:25 - Boxing brought him to Chicago.  Boxers he fought include Kid Gavalan, Ezra Charles, Sonny Williams, etc.

11:23 He met his wife at a dance in Chicago.  He asked her out to a watermelon party.  She wasn’t going to go but her friend was going so she went.  He made a vow that the next girl he got pregnant he would marry and he wouldn’t care what she looked like or anything he was just going to marry her.

He went bribed the colonel with a new air conditioner and the colonel called the postmaster general and made him hire Mr Pittman.  This is how and when blacks began getting promoted at the post office.
16:22 He was a pioneer in the plumbing business in Chicago.  Black people wouldn’t use him but whites would.  The whites would tell black people that other blacks were not good plumbers.  he bought a storefront for his business and whites picketted him.  They couldn’t run him out of the neighborhood.  He owned a lot of property.  Later in life he wanted to turn some of his property into a mall.  His son got sweet talked by some people into some deal.  His son took over 150k out of his (Obie’s) bank account.  He got swindled.  he never fully recovered financially after that.
32:25 His brother started the Englewood Parade.  He allowed Ms. Flowers to run her campaign for State Representative out of the new motor home he bought.  She won.  She never forgot that and they are still friends.

4:00 H studied piano and went to the High School of the Performing Arts. She didn’t want to play or teach, but got a job at RCA Victor, instead. There she was a secretary, and assisted Toscanini and Horowitz and other conductors.

5:30 H got married, moved to Walinton, CT (she hated it) until her husband died, then moved to Chicago to be near her best friend from childhood. Her husband taught at U Conn.

14:50 H talks about the music she loves, and the composers she assisted.

26:40 They talk about their friendship, and how they know each other. J is from Seoul. Like Harriet, she misses a truly big city. H appreciates her so much. She ends saying she is happy, and has a good life. She didn’t think she’d be happy, but she is.

1:15 Born of 2 skaters - mom and dad is Peggy and Darryl Stroud.  He has been skating since he was 2 years old.  Mom was a smooth skater and his dad wa an artistic competitor.  His dad was considered the best in the city.  He followed his dad’s style.
2:40 He names the various rinks of old and the new ones.  He and his friends continued the “parking lot papoon” (parking lot skating that his parents started).
5:18 His style is J.B.  It was created on his block growing up.  It is an old style that was started in the early 70’s.  It’s foundation is James Brown.  It involves changes in rhythm.  One does not skate to a set rhythm.  More of a sould vibe.  JB style is like watching a composer.  Bodies orchestrate feelings to song and music.  Viewers can feel what he is feeling.  It is an improve style.  When music is smooth skater skates smoothly.  When music is agressive skater gets agressive.  He describes moves old and new.
15:00 JB came up underground.  Some felt it was too aggressive.  Like hip hop it came up against protests from within.  He helped it grow internationally.  This is the greatest thing that’s ever happened to him.  They now have commercials and movies about it.  He is hoping that it gets to the olympics in 2012.  Only the white style is there now.
24:30 The white style is sometimes called the artistic style.  It doesn’t let blacks in really.  He competed in a match and won 3rd.  The 1st and 2nd place winners said that he should have won first.  He has a format on how it can work in the olympics.
28:50 Jam skating the the white style that was stolen from the black style.  It is the Elvis Presley of skating.  Rydell (a skate making company that sponsors white skating) was influenced by (or stole) the way that jb’s where their skates in their new design.  Jb’s only wear black skates and wear them tall.  The new Rydell’s only come in black and are tall.

18:50  At around age 49, Perla’s mom started to forget things and had small memory slips.  Her condition worsened when she became very depressed.  Most doctor’s gave her anti-depressants, and no one thought it was Alzheimer’s because she was so young. 

21:50  Perla looked in the phone book for a Spanish doctor so they could speak to her mother.

Aparicio, 54, talks to StoryCorps facilitator Virginia Lora about her personal professional, and academic lives.","1:37 FA was born to a middle class family in Puerto Rico. She is one of two daughters. Her elementary and secondary education took place at an all-girls Catholic school. The treatment she received there from nuns and priests who sought to repress the girls’ sexuality played a role in her identity for years after she graduated from that school.

10:50 FA went to college at Indiana University, where she first intended to major in music. She eventually changed majors to Literature and Spanish. Observations of discrimination against Latinos and against her as a woman, coupled with what she was learning as part of her majors, greatly shaped her professional and personal interests.

19:50 FA attended graduate school at Harvard University. There, she met who would later become her husband, Sonny, a Chicano from El Paso, TX. He introduced her to Chicano culture, furthering expanding her interest in Latino and Latina identity issues. Sonny suffered from a mental illness and killed himself in 1985, when she was teaching at Stanford University.

27:45 Along colleague, FA taught “Chicano-Riqueño” literature, one of the first courses of its type, at Stanford in the mid-1980s. She then made her way to teach at Arizona University and then at the University of Illinois in Chicago, where she is now.

30:30 FA has published two books: a dissertation on translation of Spanish to English and a book on the gender politics of Salsa music.

40:00 FA believes current immigration controversies are part of a greater struggle  of “belonging.”

6:40 Their signature moves are their splits.  Chicago style skating is closely related to stepping (a chicago dance).  Lots of people who skate also step and vice versa.  At rinks after people finish skating for the evening they go to the sidelines and step.  With both you realy feel the music and your movements coincide.  They begin listing the dj’s associated with JB skating.  CMW was invited to go to Canado to do a skating show.
13:25 about every month they go to a different state to skate in a show.  They encourage kids to skate to keep them off the streets and do something productive.

12:42 While Jesse Jackson was a presidental candidate, in 1994, he came to speak at the rink.

13:00 Jamillah Ali, Muhammad Ali’s daughter, was a fan of the rink and in 1978, she brought in her father.

Previous to JB, people typically danced to organ music, while at the rink. However, by the 70s playing pre-recorded music was becoming popular.
